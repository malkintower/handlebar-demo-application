# Handlebar Kohana V3.1 Demo Application

Only the `application` and `static` (CSS, Images) folders have been included.  You will need to copy in the standard Kohana V3.1 `system` and `modules` folders.

You will also need to install the [handlebar](https://github.com/malkintower/handlebar) module from github to run this application.

I've also submitted some bug fixes to the Kohana user guide module.  Hopefully these will be included in the next version (V3.1.4).  Until then please use my forked version: [https://github.com/malkintower/userguide](https://github.com/malkintower/userguide)
